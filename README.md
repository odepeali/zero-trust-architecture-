I built a Python simulation to demonstrate Zero Trust networking principles:
1️⃣ Never trust, always verify: Each user and device is continuously checked.
2️⃣ Micro-segmentation: Users are mapped to specific network zones and VLANs.
3️⃣ Continuous authentication: Access is validated every time a user tries to enter a zone.

This demonstrates how modern networks enforce access dynamically, zone by zone, device by device  which is perfect for internal network security and demostration.
